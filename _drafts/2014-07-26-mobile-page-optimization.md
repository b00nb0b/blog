In 2010, the internet research company Comscore already predicted that within 5 year the amount of mobile users will surpass the amount of desktop users. As you can see in figure 1, the intersection will happen somewhere in 2014 which is actually the date on which this blog post is written.

Now we know the reason why its importent to optimze our webpages for mobile traffic. There are several factors which should be taken into account while optimizing for mobile (the list is not ordered in any kind):

- device display parameters
- available data network
- device performance

In the following part of this article I will explain some of this factors in detail.

#### 1. Device display parameters

- display resolution
- pixel ratio
- proper font size

#### 2. Available data network

- 1 second concentration window
- latency (dns, tcp, tls, data)
- bandwidth
- blocking elements
- above-the-fold

#### 3. Device performance

- brower render time
