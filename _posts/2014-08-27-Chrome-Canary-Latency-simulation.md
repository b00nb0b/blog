As mentioned in my article about [mobile page optimization]({{ site.baseurl }}2014/08/07/mobile-page-optimization/) a proper
testing and optimization of websites on mobile devices is crucial. By updating the Developer Toolbar in the latest
release of [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.de/chrome/browser/canary.html), Google gave us the opportunity to test our
websites under different bandwidth and latency conditions.

To simulate different bandwidth and latency, just **press F12** in Chrome Canary and press the small mobile device icon in the
top left corner of the Developer Toolbar. If you want to change advanced settings of the emulation you can additionally
**press ESC** to toggle the drawer.
